# MySupportClock

This is a simple online clock intended to support the elderly. The clock is available online at [mysupportclock.com](https://mysupportclock.com)

The supported languages for now are:

- English
- Croatian
- Spanish
- Romanian

The idea is to keep it simple but any design suggestions or contributions are welcome. 

Feel free to contact me if you would like a new language added.
